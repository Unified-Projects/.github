# Unified-Projects :computer:

Welcome to Unified-Projects! Here, we embark on a journey through the vast world of software, diving deep into its myriad dimensions. From exploring the mechanisms of NES emulators and game engines to deciphering the complexities of operating systems and chess engines, we are on a perpetual quest for knowledge.

## Our Endeavours :telescope:
    Obsidian Plugins: Understanding the architecture of plugins and how they can extend the functionality of tools like Obsidian.
    Game Engines: Deconstructing the magic behind gaming. How does a game engine bring virtual worlds to life?
    Operating Systems: Delving into the heart of computers, exploring how OSs manage resources and provide services.
    Chess Engines: Demystifying the logic and algorithms that empower computers to master this age-old game.
    NES Emulator: Journeying back in time to appreciate and learn the workings of one of gaming's golden ages.

## Our Mission :dart:

Unified-Projects is not about building products, but about building knowledge. Every project we undertake is a learning experience, a classroom without walls, where the only goal is understanding. Our explorations are documented, dissected, and shared, so that curious minds everywhere can join us on our academic adventures.
